# 🧠 SpartyTalk: A Custom Programming Language in Python

**SpartyTalk** is a domain-specific programming language (DSL) developed in Python as a university-level project. The language supports boolean expressions, variable assignments, conditionals, and scope interpretation. It was designed from scratch with custom grammar and interpreters to simulate real-world language design and parsing.

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with language design, syntax parsing, and the use of Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar for defining a language structure.

## 🧩 Language Features

- ✅ Variable declaration and assignment  
- 🔁 Conditional logic (`if`, `else`)  
- 💡 Boolean expressions and logic operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)  
- 📦 Scope management and block execution  
- 📝 Basic input/output statements

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- **Language Design:** Custom BNF grammar defining syntax rules  
- **Parsing:** Lexical and syntactic analysis using Python  
- **Interpreter:** Recursive descent parser with execution environment  
- **Error Handling:** Syntax and runtime error detection with messaging
